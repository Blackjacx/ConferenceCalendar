# Conference Calendar

This repository stores interesting tech conferences throughout the year(s).

## Details

The details of each conference are stored in a [JSON file](https://github.com/Blackjacx/ConferenceCalendar/blob/main/resources/data.json). 

This data is converted to a markdown file using a [shell script](https://github.com/Blackjacx/ConferenceCalendar/blob/main/source/gen-markdown.sh) which is currently executed manually before deployment.

When changes are pushed to the `main` branch, [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Blackjacx/ConferenceCalendar/actions) deploys this markdown file to [GitHub Pages](https://blackjacx.github.io/ConferenceCalendar).

## Deployment

To deploy the website the following steps have to be taken on the branch of the current year (referred to as `<year-branch>`):

- check that the LICENSE file date is up to date
- Run `./source/gen-markdown.sh` to update the markdown file
- Commit all changes on `<year-branch>`
- Rebase `main` on `<year-branch>`
- Push both branches
- Post the following on social media

```
Finally a new update of the #ConferenceCalendar, listing most important mobile development conferences focussing on Apple platforms for 2025:

The conferences get updated on a monthly basis since many of them did not yet announce dates and/or prices.
